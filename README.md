## About

In this project, I used React.js and Graphql to create a E-commerce, using data consuming data from [DatoCMS](https://www.datocms.com/).

Some highlights:

- The application counts 4 different filters
- Uses Material-UI
- Uses Redux
- uses a real database, fed through [DatoCMS](https://www.datocms.com/).
